These notes are for making new OMI data figures (after January 15, 2021)

For running plot_single_OMI.py, the variables in question are the
variable names in the HDF5 file, such as

  - UVAerosolIndex
  - SurfaceAlbedo
  - Reflectivity
  - SolarZenithAngle

Just look at the dictionary at the beginning of the script.

The first dataset used for these figures is the old OMI AI climatology generated in
2018 and 2019 and saved to a netCDF file. This climatology contains gridded AI
values calculated using the XTrack flag and only using rows 1-23. Currently,
the file is located on the WSL on my office computer under
  
  /home/bsorenson/Research/OMI/omi_1x1_gridded_ai.nc

NOTE: The new file is located in the same directory, but is titled

  /home/bsorenson/Research/OMI/omi_ai_V003_2005_2020.nc

Single-swath OMI data are used next. These data are currently stored on my
office computer under

  /home/bsorenson/data/OMI/H5_files/

but may be downloaded separately from the OMI data website, found at

  https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OMAERUV_003/summary

DATA READING AND PROCESSING

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

The first step in making the new figures is to read in the climatology data.
To do this, enter the directory (/home/bsorenson/Research/OMI/) and start up
a Python terminal using:

  $ python

Once starting the terminal, import functions from OMILib.py using

  >>> from OMILib import *

or

  >>> from OMILib import readOMI_NCDF,calcOMI_MonthClimo,plotOMI_NCDF_Climo,
  ... plotOMI_MonthClimo,single_swath_anomaly_climo,single_swath_anomaly_time

After reading in the functions, the climatology data must be read using:
  >>> OMI_data = readOMI_NCDF()

By default, this function assumes you are using the XTrack 1-23 dataset, 
but a different netCDF OMI dataset can be specified by adding an 'infile = '...
call to the function call.

After reading in the data, monthly climatologies must be calculated. These
monthly climatologies contain the average values for each of the 12 months
across all years in the file. For example, the April OMI monthly climatology
contains the gridded averages of all April monthly data between April 2005 and
April 2018. To calculate these values, use

  >>> OMI_data = calcOMI_MonthClimo(OMI_data)

To read in single-swath OMI data for use in the algae study, use:

  >>> from OMILib import readOMI_single_swath
  >>> OMI_algae = readOMI_single_swath('201108170732',60)

The 'OMI_algae' dictionary contains the single-swath OMI data.

plotOMI_NCDF_Climo
- - - - - - - - -  

To plot the total climatology of the OMI AI gridded monthly data, use:

  >>> plotOMI_NCDF_Climo(OMI_data)

If you want to plot starting from a time index other than 0 or from an ending
index other than 169, these can both be changed by adding 'start_idx=X' or 
'end_idx=X' to the function call.

The season may also be changed if you want to plot seasonal climatologies.
To do this, add 'season=XXXXXX' to the function call, where XXXXXX is one of
'spring','summer','autumn', or 'winter'.

plotOMI_MonthClimo
- - - - - - - - - -

To plot a single monthly climatology (i.e., the average April AI values), use

  >>> plotOMI_MonthClimo(OMI_data,month_idx)

where month_idx is the index of the desired month (0 for January, 1 for February,
2 for March, etc.). Currently, no image is saved from this.

single_swath_anomaly_climo
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

To plot a single swath of OMI data with climatology values subtracted, use

  >>> single_swath_anomaly_climo(OMI_data,swath_date)

swath_date is the date on the single-swath file you want to plot.
An example is '200804221345'. You can also plot a whole day of data by only
typing through the day in swath_date. An example is '20080422'. By default,
the monthly climatology values calculated above are subtracted,  but if you
want to subtract the total climatology for some reason, add 'month_climo=False'
to the function call.

NOTE: Currently, the single-swath files are assumed to be in 
'/home/bsorenson/data/OMI/H5_files'. This may need to be changed if running 
on a new system.

This function saves a file titled as 'omi_single_pass_ai'_file_adder_swath_date'_rows_0to'str(row_max)'.png'
An example is 'omi_single_pass_ai_mnth_anom_200804221345_rows_0to60.png'

single_swath_anomaly_time
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 

To plot a single swath of OMI data with the climatological averages of all
swaths from that same date and time across all years, use:

  >>> single_swath_anomaly_time(single_swath,climo_date)

single_swath is the date and time of the main swath to plot, formatted as
'200804221345'. climo_date is a date string that defines which climatology
file directory to look at. The climatology director contains symbolic links
to the correct files for that date and time. For example, if you want to plot
the swath climatology for the ~1345 swath, climo_date would be set to 
'04221345'.

This function saves a file titled as:
'omi_single_pass_ai_single_anom_200804221345_rows_0to60.png'

plot_OMI_v_MODIS
- - - - - - - - -

To plot a scatter plot of OMI single-swath data vs MODIS chlorophyll-α data,
use this function. NOTE: before running this function, you must read in the
daily averaged MODIS chlorophyll-α data (see README_modis in ~/Research/MODIS).
To do this, you must add the MODIS directory to the working path by

  >>> sys.path.append('/home/bsorenson/Research/MODIS')

Then read in the MODIS data:
 
  >>> from MODISLib import *
  >>> MODIS_data = read_MODIS('20110817')

Then, plot the OMI AI algae-screened data against the MODIS data using:

  >>> plot_OMI_v_MODIS(MODIS_data,OMI_algae)

Currently (2021/03/08), no images are saved.
